The Hottest Topics in Machine Learning - DataCamp learning project solution (tasks https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/158)

Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is one of the top machine learning conferences in the world where groundbreaking work is published. This Project analyzes a large collection of NIPS research papers from the past decade to discover the latest trends in machine learning. The techniques used here to handle large amounts of data can be applied to other text datasets as well.

Project uses Python, Pandas library and Natural Language Processing in Python (sklearn specifically).
